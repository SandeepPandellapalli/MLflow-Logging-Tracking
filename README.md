# MLflow-Logging-Tracking
This repository demonstrates using MLflow for managing and tracking ML experiments. It includes setting up and executing a Logistic Regression model, with detailed tracking of parameters and metrics. Ideal for those interested in MLflow for enhancing model management and reproducibility.

## Problem Statement
In the realm of machine learning, managing and tracking experiments efficiently remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with multiple model iterations and configurations. This project addresses the need for a systematic approach to log, compare, and analyze machine learning experiments, using MLflow. The objective is to demonstrate the setup and execution of a logistic regression model, leveraging MLflow's capabilities to provide comprehensive tracking of model parameters, performance metrics, and experiment artifacts, thereby enhancing reproducibility and streamlining the management of machine learning workflows.
